Project Context — Travel Agency Website (Lead Capture)
1. Project Overview

A small travel agency operates curated holiday packages across four hill-station destinations in South India: Ooty, Munnar, Kodaikanal, and Coorg.

The agency currently receives customer enquiries through phone calls and WhatsApp messages, which leads to missed opportunities and lack of structured lead tracking.

The goal of this project is to build a simple public-facing website where potential customers can browse destination packages and submit their interest.

When a user submits their details, the system captures the lead and displays a confirmation toast message stating that a welcome message has been sent to their WhatsApp.

2. Problem Statement

Travel enquiries are currently handled manually via calls and messaging apps, resulting in:

No centralized place to showcase travel packages

Difficulty capturing and tracking customer interest

Lost or delayed responses to potential customers

No digital presence for discovery

A lightweight website is needed to present travel offerings and capture customer leads in a structured manner.
